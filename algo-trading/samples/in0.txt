The fastest route is to jump from
RickRoll we can only go to CatPiano
CatPiano we can jump to BabyYoda or ImNotACat, but because BabyYoda makes us take one more jump to get to ImNotACat it is faster to go to ImNotACat
ImNotACat means we make one jump to the end
TwentyTwentyOne and we do a final jump again to show that we reached the end.

RickRoll -> CatPiano -> ImNotACat -> TwentyTwentyOne
