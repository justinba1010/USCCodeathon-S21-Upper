This is Biskit. Biskit is taking a heavy course-load and all their classes require different books and operating systems. Since Biskit doesn't believe in dual booting, they have a different laptop for each class! Just one more problem, 
Biskit never turns off their laptops, and if they touch they overheat! Help Biskit declutter by showing all the ways of stacking books and laptops such that no laptop is adjacent to a laptop. Represent any books by 0 and any laptops by 1. To show your dedication to neatness please output the bit strings in ascending order. The input is a single integer representing the size of the bit strings to produce. The size of the string to produce will be an integer N where 1=<N=<30.
